## What is this?

Late 2018 I started working on a serious entreprise product for my employer at the time. A big outsourcing company finally taking the leap to actually
build and sell software rather just use. 

The decision would lead to one the most of craziest days I spent writing code. 

As usual we with most B2B products you need to be in the market as fast as possible, in this industry speed is everything.

Your first mover advantage can be a moat for real. 

Once I got the full lowdown for the product, typically a ATS+CRM software for this recrutiing firm. 

I and a team of 2 developers, a project manager and one of the smartest product designer I know, rolled up our sleeves
and got to work 

This book is not about the project, this book is about how I would have built that product now. 

I have to warn you we get technical really fast and of course we are doing all these in Node.js and MongoDB.

Each folder is a module or a problem we try to solve with all the dependcies [Basic requirement, problem statement, UI design, npm modules, external helpers and of course the solution]



## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to build something similar would learn a lot of from the patterns and the concepts for their project , seasoned engineers who want to learn a thing or two, or anyone who wants to expose their juniour developers to these concepts.
